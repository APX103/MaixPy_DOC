Since it is an open source project, everyone is welcome to join in to improve MaixPy.

Due to the large number of people, we need a common agreement (including format, style, etc.)

There are mainly the following aspects that can be involved:

* [document modification](doc_convention.md)

* [MaixPy firmware bug fix, feature optimization, feature addition, etc.](code_convention.md)
