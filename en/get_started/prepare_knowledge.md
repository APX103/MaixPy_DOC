Basic knowledge
=========

To get started with `MaixPy`，we recommend at least the following basics:

* With patience, calm down and study the technology, read the documentation and then write the code.

* Have `Python` or `Micropython` knowledge, we will use `Python` basic grammar.
  * If you don't know anything about `Python` but you have programmed before, please search for `Python basics` first. 
  * If you've never programmed before, this documentation will be hard to understand. Make sure to learn, at least, basic `Python` before reading it.

* Can understand the basic circuit diagram

* Learn Micropython here： [MicroPython Language Introduction](http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/index.html)

* General differences between MicroPython and Python can be found here：[MicroPython vs CPython（Python3](http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/genrst/index.html) 查看

If you don't follow the previous points, then be prepared to struggle while developing, it will be extremely difficult!
