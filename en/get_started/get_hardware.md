## Required hardware

### ä¸€A development board

### USB Type C cable

Type-C is chosen because it's reversible and it's very friendly for development.

If you're buying from the official Taobao store, you can ask them to include it with your order. Type-C cables are also very common with Android phones.

### Screen

By default, the LCD (24-pin interface) of the st7789 driver chip is used with a resolution of 320x240.

If you're buying from the official Taobao store, you can ask them to include it with your order.

### Camera

Uses ov2640 by default

If you're buying from the official Taobao store, you can ask them to include it with your order.

### Micro SD Card (TF Card) (optional)

Not applicable SD card can also manipulate files. Some of the internal Flash has been reserved as a file system, but Flash is very slow!

In order to facilitate the quick operation of the picture file, you can choose to purchase a `Micro SD` card, MaixPy has built-in SPI SD card protocol driver.

When purchasing, try to choose a new Micro SD card with fast speed, such as SD 2 generation protocol, Class10 memory card.

Of course, the quality of SD cards on the market is uneven, and the SPI mode may not be compatible. Try to buy a regular card. Or maybe you should customize the driver code ~~

As shown below, the two cards on the left are not supported by the MaixPy driver. Both the middle and the right are supported, but the class10 card in the middle is the fastest.

### ST-Link (used to update the firmware of the STM32 on the development board Maix Go) (optional)

If you purchase a `Maix Go`, it has an embedded `STM32` chip to simulate the USB-to-Serial converter, as well as `JTAG`. If you want to upgrade its firmware later on, it is recommended to buy an `ST-Link` programmer.

### JTAG Debugger (optional)

The `K210`  chip supports `JTAG` debugging. If you need to debug, you will need to use the `JTAG` debugger. Please check the official `Sipeed` Taobao store to buy one.

If you are using a `Maix Go` development board, you won't need to purchase the `JTAG` debugger separately. The `Max Go` development board already has an integrated `STM32` chip that can emulate `JTAG` (`STM32` uses `CMSIS-DAP` or `open-ec` firmware), `open-ec` firmware is currently not supported, support will be added later. Please refer to the `open-ec` GitHub project page for more information.
