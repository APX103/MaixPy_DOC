======

Here peripheral means offchip modules, for example: `LCD`、 Camera、 touchscreen etc.

The peripheral related to vision are put into [machine vision]((../machine_vision/README.md)), modules as follows:

* [lcd](../machine_vision/lcd.md): Display image on LCD
* [sensor](../machine_vision/sensor.md): Get camera data, we name it as `sensor` just like openmv do, but not totally the same as openmv's, see the doc

Other Modules:

* [touchscreen](./touchscreen.md): Touchscreen related operation, like get click status or get click coordinate
